This repo contains some of the configuration files and wallpapers that I would use whenever I have a brand new linux installation. they are mostly configurations for i3 window manager. Feel free to use them. :blush: 

Special thanks to Alex from [Code Cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4), as I followed his guide to customize and rice my linux disktop. :wink:
